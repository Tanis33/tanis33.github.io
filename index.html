      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm Ben Tanis, a passionate computer scientist and problem solver from Dillsburg, PA. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Calvin University in May 2024, where I also had the unique opportunity to study engineering and immerse myself in German language and culture at Technische Universität in Berlin. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on projects like developing a mobile application for the LGWI Water Monitor, aimed at aiding a non-profit organization with data management, and creating "Peet's for Knights," a mobile app designed to streamline menu and order management using React Native and SQL databases. </p>

      <p> My professional experience includes working as a Reseller Specialist at Apple Inc., where I honed my skills in customer engagement and sales techniques, and trained sales representatives across multiple stores. Additionally, I spent a summer as Adventure Staff at Ligonier Camp and Conference Center, designing and leading team-building activities and adventure sports. My technical skills span a variety of languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Java, and SQL, among others. Outside of my professional pursuits, I have been actively involved in Calvin Esports, captaining the first Calvin Apex Team, and playing on the Calvin Rugby team. I am always eager to take on new challenges and continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>
